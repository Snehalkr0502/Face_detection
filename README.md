Tools & Technologies: Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, PIL, Haar Cascades

Developed a full-featured GUI-based face detection system using Python and Tkinter for real-time interaction.

Implemented face and eye detection using OpenCV with Haar Cascade classifiers across three modes: Image, Video, and Webcam input.

Enabled dynamic image loading and frame processing with real-time face rectangle annotations using cv2 and PIL.ImageTk.

Integrated filedialog for browsing and loading media, and messagebox for robust input validation and user feedback.

Used modular programming and event-driven design to switch between multiple screens: login, image analysis, video detection, and live webcam feed.

Applied multistage image pre-processing and detection pipelines using cv2.cvtColor, detectMultiScale, and rectangle overlays.

Focused on usability with clean layout management and screen transitions for an intuitive user experience.
